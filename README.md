# Netflix Movie Data Analysis

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to perform data analysis on Netflix movie data, including creating a DataFrame, analyzing movie durations, and exploring movie genres.

## Introduction
Netflix has evolved from a DVD rental service to a global entertainment giant. Data analysis plays a significant role in understanding trends and patterns in the entertainment industry.

## Data Collection and Preparation
The data for this project was provided by a friend in the form of a CSV file containing Netflix data. This CSV file will be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

## Initial Analysis: Average Movie Durations
One observation from the data is that the average duration of movies on Netflix has been declining. The average movie durations for the years 2011 to 2020 are provided.

## Project Scope and Tools
The primary tools used in this project are Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. The Python programming language is also used.

## Creating a DataFrame from Scratch
The first step in the analysis is to create a DataFrame using a Python dictionary. Code examples and explanations are provided for creating the DataFrame using the given average movie duration data.

## Data Analysis: Movie Genres and Durations
The next step is to analyze the relationship between movie genres and their durations. Movies will be categorized into different genres and assigned colors based on the genre for visualization.

## Visualizing Movie Genres and Durations
Matplotlib will be used to create scatter plots to visualize movie durations and genres. Different colors will be assigned to genres to make the visualizations more informative.

## Final Thoughts and Conclusion
The key findings of the analysis are summarized, including the significance of the results in the context of the declining average movie durations trend. Possible future directions for the project or other analyses that could be conducted are also discussed.

## Documentation
The code for this project can be found in `notebook.ipynb`.
The datasets can be found on `datasets` folder.
