Project Overview:

Objective: Perform data analysis on Netflix movie data, including creating a DataFrame, analyzing movie durations, and exploring movie genres.

1. Introduction to the Project:

   • Discuss how Netflix has evolved from a DVD rental service to a global entertainment giant.
   
   • Highlight the significance of data analysis in understanding trends and patterns in the entertainment industry.

3. Data Collection and Preparation:
   
    • Mention that your friend has provided a CSV file containing Netflix data.
   
    • Explain that the CSV file will be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

5. Initial Analysis: Average Movie Durations:
   
    • Discuss the observation that the average duration of movies on Netflix has been declining.
   
    • Present the provided information on average movie durations for the years 2011 to 2020.

7. Project Scope and Tools:
   
    • Introduce the tools you'll be using, primarily Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.
   
    • Briefly discuss the Python programming language.

8. Creating a DataFrame from Scratch:
   
    • Explain that you'll start by creating a DataFrame using a Python dictionary.
   
    • Provide code examples and explanations for creating the DataFrame using the given average movie duration data.

10. Data Analysis: Movie Genres and Durations:
    
    • Describe your plan to analyze the relationship between movie genres and their durations.
    
    • Mention that you'll categorize movies into different genres and assign colors based on the genre for visualization.

12. Visualizing Movie Genres and Durations:
    
    • Detail how you'll use Matplotlib to create scatter plots to visualize movie durations and genres.
    
    • Mention that you'll assign different colors to genres to make the visualizations more informative.

14. Final Thoughts and Conclusion:
    
    • Summarize the key findings of your analysis.
    
    • Reflect on the significance of the results in the context of the declining average movie durations trend.
    
    • Discuss possible future directions for the project or other analyses that could be conducted.
